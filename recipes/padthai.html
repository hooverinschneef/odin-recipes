   <h3> This delicious Pad Thai recipe serves 3 people and is 100% vegetarian.</h3>

   <p>This Veggie Pad Thai is first and foremost RAINBOW, which is the only fun way to eat anything in life.</p>
   <p>It is brown rice noodles, and spiralized veggies (because veggies in noodle form feels like more noodles), and a super tangy-delicious Pad Thai sauce that you just shake up in a jar in about five seconds flat, and peanuts that almost instantly start to soak up the sauce, and a gently scrambled egg that kind of cream-ifies the whole thing.</p>


    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces brown rice noodles</li>
        <li>1 zucchini</li>
        <li>1 red pepper</li>
        <li>half a yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>2 tbsps oil</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup peanuts</li>
        <li>fresh herbs chopped</li>
        <li>sauce ingredients</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the uncooked noodles in a bowl of cold water to soak. Spiralize the zucchini, red pepper, and onion into noodle-like shapes. Cut the carrots into very small pieces (or spiralize them, too, if they’re big enough).</li>
        <li>Shake up the sauce ingredients in a jar.</li>
        <li>Heat a tablespoon of oil over medium high heat. Add the veggies – stir fry with tongs for 2-3 minutes or until tender-crisp (if they are not spiralized, they might need longer). Be careful not to overcook them – they’ll get soggy and heavy. Transfer to a dish and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan. Drain the noodles – they should be softened by now. Add the noodles to the hot pan and stir fry for a minute, using tongs to toss. Add the sauce and stir fry for another minute or two, until the sauce is starting to thicken and stick to the noodles. Push the noodles aside to make a little room for the egg – pour the beaten egg into the pan and let it sit for 30 seconds or so. Toss everything around with the tongs. The egg mixture will stick to the noodles and everything will start getting sticky.</li>
        <li>Add in the vegetables, toss together, and remove from heat. Stir in the peanuts and herbs and serve immediately.</li>
        
    </ol>
