    <h3>These classic Tex-Mex nachos are loaded to the MAX! Avoid soggy nachos by briefly baking them before topping with cheese, seasoned beef, refried beans, guacamole, and salsa. They're a great snack, party appetizer, or even casual weeknight dinner.
    </h3>
    <p>Nachos have always been my “I’m too tired to cook after grocery shopping” dinner. We’ve all been there, am I right? You’ve spent a fair amount of your paycheck on groceries, but you’re so tired you need a quick meal to throw together.
        Nachos have it all: protein, carbs, veggies, and—the most important thing—cheese! They’re also fully customizable to suit a solo diner or a group gathered for chow.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp oil</li>
            <li>1 pound vegetarian ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cups refried beans</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 large bag of tortilla chips</li>
            <li>4 ounces cheddar and colby jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup pico de gallo</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cilantro</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper</li>
            <li>spice mix</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Combine all of the spices (chili powder through cayenne) together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil on medium high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the ground beef to the pan and season it with all of the taco spice blend. As the meat cooks, use a spoon to break the meat up into crumbles.</li>
            <li>Cook for about 8 minutes until the meat has browned and drain the fat using a colander.

                Return the meat to the pan and add the refried beans and the water. Heat the mixture until the beans are smooth and warmed through. Reduce the heat to low and keep the beef-bean mixture warm while you prepare the chips.</li>
            <li>Toast the chips</li>
            <li>Assemble and bake the nachos and then sprinkle the remaining cheese over the beef and return the pan to the oven for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Top and Serve!</li>
        </ol>
