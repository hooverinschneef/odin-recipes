    <h3>Homemade pizza crust may sound difficult to you. Why waste the time when you can just buy frozen pizza dough? Frozen pizza dough is definitely more convenient, but homemade pizza crust has a delicious flavor and texture that only comes from YOU!

    </h3>

    <p>A simple recipe for extra cheese pizza on top of the best homemade pizza dough. Makes one 12-inch pizza or you can make two pizzas from my entire crust recipe and double the toppings listed below.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 recipe homemade pizza crust</li>
        <li>pizza sauce</li>
        <li>8 oz mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>ground basil or italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pizza dough through step 6, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C) as described in step 4.</li>
        <li>Top the dough with the pizza sauce, then the sliced mozzarella, then the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, then sprinkle with basil.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes. For the last minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That’s optional.</li>
        <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.</li>
        
    </ol>
